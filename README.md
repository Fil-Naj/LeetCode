# Leetcode
Welcome to my LeetCode journey!

Here is where I focus on my Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge, as well as my problem solving ability. All work is done in C# using .NET 6.

## Goal
The goal of this journey is to continue my study of DSA and improve my programming in C#.   
I try to optimise my code as much as I can, without losing understanding of what's going on. I also try to experiment with the new features in .NET 6 to get more comfortable with the langauge and framework.

The main goal, however, is to write *Blazingly Fast* code.

## Follow Me!
Sometimes, I will solve the problems without committing my answers here for whatever reason.
